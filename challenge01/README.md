openLilyLib Engraving Challenges
================================

Challenge 1 - Chopin/Godowsky
-----------------------------

As the idea for these challenges arose from engraving complex late-romantic piano music
it seems natural to start with such a challenge.  But we decided *not* to use a song by Oskar
Fried as the first task because we thought it appropriate to start something from scratch
ourselves. The issue was to find something of uttermost complexity in the late romantic
piano repertoire, but something that's clearly out of copyright.
