Schumann piano piece

Not too much difficulty.  Accents go to other end of note and will need flipping.  Can't currently work out how to mix minim and crochet on chord (bar 34, RH).  Could not put hairpins in with default layout: too tight and had to stretch staves apart.

Prettying.  Changes directions to Century schoolbook bold.  Flipped some accents.  Bars 13 to 27 - flipped the stems.  (The minims were stem down, since Sibelius appears to ignore the voicing if there's a hidden rest on the same note, as opposed to a visible rest).  This then flipped the ties in a horrible way. Flipped all them.  Also the accents.  Ditto.

Set paper to landscape to better match original, adjusted margins and font size.  Put forced line breaks where original has them.  Indented first system (drag).  Adjusted staff margins to occupy more of vertical space.  Bodged bar 34 with notes in voice 1 and 3 for "chord" of minim and crochet.  Lots of rests to delete and slur to flip.
