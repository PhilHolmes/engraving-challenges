LilyPond Engraving Challenges
=============================

The post-production discussion of a big LilyPond based [Edition]
(http://lilypondblog.org/category/fried-songs/) raised considerable renewed interest
in the performance of LilyPond with complex notational challenges.

While LilyPond's default output is extraordinary it is still not perfect - the amount
of necessary tweaks in said edition is a telling witness. We were quite interested
in getting a better picture how the balance is between a relatively small number of
tweaks that are relatively complicated to achieve.

In order to investigate this further we thought of a "contest" with one or more
engraving challenges. These challenges should be meticulously documented so we
can analyze them and discuss potential targets for improvements in LilyPond and its tools.

The challenges are explicitly meant to be comparisons with other notation programs,
but we deliberately don't want to call them "contests". Careful documentation and analysis
is much more important than achieving the best results in the shortest time.

If you're interested in participating in this adventure feel free to contact us through
`ul at openlilylib dot org` (or the [lilypond-user]
(https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/lilypond-user) mailing list). You should be confident
to be able to work efficiently with your notation program and have a current version of it.
It would be good if you would also have experience with version control and can work with
our Git repository. But that's not a hard requirement and we can assist you with that.

The "rules" of the contest are explained in the 
[Wiki pages](https://github.com/openlilylib/engraving-challenges/wiki) -
it's very important that anybody taking part adheres to them very strictly in order to create
a complete chain of history for the interpretation.
